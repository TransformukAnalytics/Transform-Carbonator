#  The V2 is the Second Iteration of the Transform Carbon Calculator

In this version, of the **Transform Carbon Calculator** we've improved the accuracy of the calculations and added new features to get more accuracte results.

The goal of this tool is to provide an easy to use calculator to measure carbon emissions and offer actionable insights to reduce them.

# Transform Carbon Calculator: Variables

This section outlines the variables used in the calculator:

- **Aggregate Page Size**  
  The total size (in megabytes or gigabytes) of all resources required to load a webpage. This includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.

- **Estimated Page Views (Per Month)**  
  The average number of monthly page views, based on data from Google Analytics 4 (GA4) over the last 3 months.

- **Avg Data Transfer Per Visit (MB)**  
  The average amount of data transferred (in megabytes) per individual visit to the website.

- **Avg Data Transfer Per Visit (GB)**  
  The same as above but converted to gigabytes for easier scaling in larger calculations.

- **Carbon Usage (Total)**  
  The total carbon emissions resulting from all website visits, based on data transfer, device type, and energy use.

- **Page Downloads (New Users MB)**  
  The total data downloaded by new visitors (in megabytes), accounting for full-page loads due to no caching.

- **Page Downloads (Returning Users MB)**  
  The total data downloaded by returning visitors (in megabytes), often reduced due to cached assets.

- **Device (Desktop)**  
  The percentage of visits to the website that come from desktop devices.

- **Device (Mobile)**  
  The percentage of visits to the website that come from mobile devices.

- **Returning User %**  
  The percentage of total visitors who are returning users.

- **New User %**  
  The percentage of total visitors who are visiting the website for the first time.

- **Transfer Energy Usage Estimation**  
  An estimate of the energy consumed during data transfers for all website visits.

- **Energy Consumption**  
  The total energy used by all website visitors, factoring in device type and data transfer rates.

- **Emission Factor (Mobile)**  
  The emissions factor (grams of CO2 per kWh) specific to mobile devices.

- **Emission Factor (Laptop)**  
  The emissions factor (grams of CO2 per kWh) specific to laptops.

- **Emission Factor**  
  The overall emissions factor that combines mobile, desktop, and other device types.

- **Renewable Energy**  
  The percentage of energy consumption offset through the use of renewable energy sources.

# Generating Figures for Each Variable

The `Page Size` is derived from the [Beacon Digital Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com).  
Beacon measures the page size by analysing the total weight of all assets (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) loaded by the browser during the **first page load** of a user's initial visit.

The `Estimated Page Views (Per Month)` metric is calculated using [Google Analytics 4 (GA4)](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/). The calculation takes the total page views from the last **three months** and averages them to determine the monthly estimate. 

The `Avg Data Transfer Per Visit (MB)` Figure is derived by multiplying the `Page Size` by the  `Estimated Page Views (Per Month)`. Page size comes from Beacon & Estimated Page Views (Per month) comes from GA4.

The `Avg Data Transfer Per Visit (GB)` Figure is derived by multiplying the `Page Size` by the  `Estimated Page Views (Per Month)`. Page size comes from Beacon & Estimated Page Views (Per month) comes from GA4.

The `Carbon Usage (Total)` Figure is currently under review. The source and calculation method will be added soon. *TBC*.

The `Page Downloads (New Users MB)` The source will be added soon. *TBC*.

The `Page Downloads (Returning Users MB)` The source will be added soon. *TBC*.

The `Device (Desktop)` Figure is derived from [Google Analytics 4 (GA4)](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/). It represents the average percentage of desktop visits over the last 3 months, excluding tablets. Percentages are adjusted to ensure a total of 100%.  

The `Device (Mobile)` Figure is derived from [Google Analytics 4 (GA4)](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/). It represents the average percentage of laptop visits over the last 3 months, excluding tablets. Percentages are adjusted to ensure a total of 100%.  

The`Returning Users (%)` Figure is derived from [Google Analytics 4 (GA4)](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/). It represents the average percentage of returning users over the last 3 months. Percentages are adjusted to ensure a total of 100%.  

The `New Users (%)` Figure is derived from [Google Analytics 4 (GA4)](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/). It represents the average percentage of new users over the last 3 months. Percentages are adjusted to ensure a total of 100%.

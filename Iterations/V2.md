### Final Calulation

- **Carbon Emissions (per month)**  
  The final calculation of the `Carbon Emissions (Per Month)` is used to estimate the monthly carbon emissions.

### Notes:  
- All measures are calculated and sourced. we aim to maintain **transparency** in methodology.  
- Refer to the **Generating Figures for Each Measure** section below for more details on sourcing and calculations.



# Generating Figures for Each Measure  

## How Variables Are Measured and Sourced  

---

### General Website Data  

- **`Page Size`**  
  - Derived from the [Beacon Digital Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com).  
  - Beacon measures the page size by analyzing the total weight of all assets (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) loaded by the browser during the **first page load** of a user's initial visit.

- **`Estimated Page Views (Per Month)`**  
  - Calculated using [Google Analytics 4 (GA4)](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/).  
  - The calculation takes the total page views from the last **three months** and averages them to determine the monthly estimate.

---

### Data Transfer  

- **`Avg Data Transfer Per Visit (MB)`**  
  - Derived by multiplying the `Page Size` by the `Estimated Page Views (Per Month)`.  
  - Page size comes from Beacon, and Estimated Page Views (Per Month) comes from GA4.

- **`Avg Data Transfer Per Visit (GB)`**  
  - Same as above but converted to gigabytes for easier scaling in larger calculations.

---

### Carbon Usage  

- **`Carbon Usage (Total)`**  
  - *Currently under review*.  
  - The source and calculation method will be added soon. *TBC*.

---

### Data Downloads  

- **`Page Downloads (New Users MB)`**  
  - Derived from developer tools.  
  - This is currently a manual process.

- **`Page Downloads (Returning Users MB)`**  
  - Derived from developer tools.  
  - This is currently a manual process.

---

### Device Usage  

- **`Device (Desktop)`**  
  - Derived from [Google Analytics 4 (GA4)](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/).  
  - Represents the average percentage of desktop visits over the last **3 months**, excluding tablets.  
  - Percentages are adjusted to ensure a total of 100%.  

- **`Device (Mobile)`**  
  - Derived from [Google Analytics 4 (GA4)](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/).  
  - Represents the average percentage of mobile visits over the last **3 months**, excluding tablets.  
  - Percentages are adjusted to ensure a total of 100%.  

---

### User Data  

- **`Returning Users (%)`**  
  - Derived from [Google Analytics 4 (GA4)](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/).  
  - Represents the average percentage of returning users over the last **3 months**.  
  - Percentages are adjusted to ensure a total of 100%.  

- **`New Users (%)`**  
  - Derived from [Google Analytics 4 (GA4)](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/).  
  - Represents the average percentage of new users over the last **3 months**.  
  - Percentages are adjusted to ensure a total of 100%.  

---

### Energy Estimations  

- **`Transfer Energy Usage Estimation`**  
  - Estimated using energy consumption per GB transferred.  
  - Currently, we are using an average of **0.3 kWh per GB**, based on studies that estimate energy consumption to range between **0.2–0.5 kWh per GB**, depending on factors like server efficiency, user device, and network conditions.

- **`Energy Consumption`**  
  - Calculated by multiplying the `Avg Data Transfer Per Visit (GB)` by the `Transfer Energy Usage Estimation`.  
  - The result represents the estimated energy consumption for each visit.

---

### Emission Factors  

- **`Emission Factor (Mobile)`**  
  - **Calculated as follows:**  (PUE) X Base Rate + Mobile AVG 
    - Multiply Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) by the `Transfer Energy Usage Estimation`.  
      - PUE: Average value of **1.5** based on high, standard, and less-efficient data centers.  
    - Add the mobile emission factor.  
      - Calculated by averaging smartphone WiFi (**0.06 kWh/GB**) and smartphone cellular (**0.2 kWh/GB**) usage, with a middle value of **0.13 kWh/GB**.  
    - The sum gives the final emission factor for mobile devices.

- **`Emission Factor (Desktop)`**  
  - **Calculated as follows:**  (PUE) X Base Rate + Deesktop AVG 
    - Multiply Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) by the `Transfer Energy Usage Estimation`.  
      - PUE: Average value of **1.5** based on high, standard, and less-efficient data centers.  
    - Add the desktop emission factor.  
      - Calculated by averaging **0.01 kWh/GB** and **0.05 kWh/GB**, with a middle value of **0.03 kWh/GB**.  
    - The sum gives the final emission factor for desktop devices.

- **`Emission Factor`**  
  - Derived from the global average of **0.5 kg CO₂ per kWh of energy consumed**.  
  - Note: This value can vary significantly depending on the region and the energy mix. For this calculation, we use the global average.

### Sustainability  

- **`Renewable Energy`**
  - `Not currently used in final calculation`
  - In theory: A binary indicator (**1 for "Yes" and 0 for "No"**) to determine if the energy source is renewable.  
  - Checked using the [Green Web Foundation](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/) to verify if the website is hosted on renewable energy-powered servers.  
  - If the energy is renewable, **1/3 of `Carbon Emissions (per month)`** is deducted.

- **`Carbon Emissions (per month)`**  
  - Is calculated by doing `Avg data transfer per visit (gb)` Multiplied by `Emission Factor`

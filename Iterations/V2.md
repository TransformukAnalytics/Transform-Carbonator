# Further Breakdown

### Description
The `Page Size` variable represents the size of a webpage (in kilobytes or megabytes) during the **first visit**. This variable is essential for calculating the carbon emissions associated with loading a webpage.

### Source
Page Size: The value for `Page Size` is derived from the [Beacon Digital Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com).  
Beacon measures the page size by analysing the total weight of all assets (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) loaded by the browser during the **first page load** of a user's initial visit.

### Description
The `Estimated Page Views (Per Month)` variable represents the average number of page views a website receives each month. This value helps estimate the total energy usage and carbon emissions over a given period.

### Source
This metric is calculated using data from **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)**. The calculation takes the total page views from the last **three months** and averages them to determine the monthly estimate.
